From his journey you can add photos, videos, share experiences in the form of notes or messages in the forums.

Going abroad and do not know what places to visit? After clicking on a location on the map or by entering a filter to display all points of interest in your destination. Including routes! For ease of filtering and search the notebook support tagging.    

If you are a seasoned traveler, you can specify a route to the visited place. Save others, less experienced, users plenty of time to find the most appropriate way. You will feel good to help, and others will be grateful.

You will be able to evaluate the recommendations of other users to enhance their reputation. Users with high reputation have great confidence that advises really well.

We plan to integrate with Google Maps, for better understanding and easier to find objects.
